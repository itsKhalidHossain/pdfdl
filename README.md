# pdfdl â€” Intelligent PDF Downloader

`pdfdl` is a Python command-line tool to intelligently crawl academic or article-based websites and download PDF files. It supports redirects, content detection, and queue-based crawling of PDF viewer pages.

_It only works on journals built with [OJS](https://pkp.sfu.ca/software/ojs/) for now._

## Features

- Detects direct PDF links and downloads them.
- Parses HTML pages to discover viewer or download links (e.g., `<a class="pdf">`, `<a class="download" download>`).
- Follows redirects and resolves final URLs before adding them to the queue.
- Automatically decodes filenames from headers or URLs.
- Supports custom User-Agent strings.
